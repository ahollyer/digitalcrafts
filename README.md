### Notes from the JavaScript Crash Course


###Project Notes

I'm sure I missed some things, but I tried to leave comments to explain what each bit of code does. It was all pretty basic, but it was cool to learn the basics from someone who really understands the language. I learned a lot!

Let me know if anything's confusing.

I'm always looking to learn new things and meet new people. Feel free to contact me if you want to learn together!
